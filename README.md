In this project, I use modules such as
1. NLTK
2. re
3. sklearn
First of all,I download nltk (stopwords, wordnet) which are needed for use
In data preprocessing, removing punctuation and other things except a-z and A-Z
and then lowercasing and splitting
for this project, I use Lemmatization for text data 
For Vectorizer, I use TF-IDF Vectorizer
For Classification Model, I Use 'MultiNomialNB(from Naive_Bayes)'
For Prediction Matirx, I use (accuracy score and confusion matrix)
